## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This is the first challenge that i have really used CSS Grid in. I learnt things like grid repeat, auto-fit, auto-fill

```css
.div5 {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(170px, 1fr);
}
```


### Continued development

I will like to work more on my CSS Grid and try to get better at making responsive webpages.
